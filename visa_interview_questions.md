# Research topics: Machine learning paradigms 

1. Which university and course? What is your purpose for visiting the US? Why are you applying for a visa?

Answer: 
* Well, Sir/Mam I am going to pursue my master's in Computer and information science specialization in artificial intelligence  from the University of South Dakota, 
* I will continue my research on the curated dataset problem in deep learning under the direction of Prof.Santosh KC.

2. Who is sponsoring you? What is your father’s/family annual income?
Answer: 
First of all, 
* I have personal savings of around $ 20k by working in Nepal for about three years. Currently, I am working at BP Koirala eye foundation as a Senior Software engineer. Before that, I was leading a team of engineers at Fusemachines. 
* My parents have savings of around $ 50k for my graduate studies. 
* My father is running a dragon fruit farm in 2 Acer. His annual income is around $30k  after reducing other costs.
* My mother is a mathematics teacher at Ganajagriti Higher Secondary School, which is a government school, Her income is around $7-8k thousand per year 
* In addition, we also have a 4-storeyed house on the highway. 3 floors are on rent from where we are saving $ 7-8k  per year. 
* My brother is also supporting me he is a senior software engineer at Fact Technology his salary is $12k. 
 
3. Why the US? Why not other countries? Why not Nepal?
Answer: [1]. 

* Well Since 2015 I am working on a machine learning paradigm to solve Heavy Curated datasets in deep learning 
* Researchers and parallel computing hardware are driving factors for solving this current problem and designing new effective algorithms.
* Around 70% of researchers are from the USA working on this problem.
* Their research is supported by National Science Foundation(NSF), MANG, and Nvidia by providing hardware infrastructures like Tensor Processing Units (TPU), Graphics Processing Units (GPU), and Supercomputers so that they can train new deep learning algorithms.
* So I choose the USA to work more on this problem rather than other countries.





4. Why this university? Why USD?
Answer: [1]. 

* My Prof.Santosh KC is also doing research on this problem. His research profile Citation: 5216, h-index: 38, motivated me to work with him. 
* After a bidirectional meeting with him, I found that they are using coral TPU, Jetson Nano, and supercomputers supported by google, Nvidia, and an open mind to training deep learning algorithms. They are also organizing symposiums and conferences in computer vision and healthcare to foster research culture.
* And the computer science and artificial intelligence course offered by the USD Including advanced machine learning, Computer Vision, Design Analysis, and Computer algorithms aids to solve the current problem in machine learning.  For These reasons, I am going to join USD.
 
5. Why this course or major? (Combine with Why Masters?) Why Masters?
Answer: 
* Since 2015 I am doing research on curated dataset problems in deep learning. Publishing several research papers.
* I would like to escalate my research boundaries to solve four global challenges in ai algorithms. 
* This master course is all about designing efficient algorithms. This specialization course in artificial intelligence helps me to solve these problems. 
 
6. Which and how many Universities (both admits and rejects) did you apply to?
Answer: 
* In the fall of 2022 I applied to 5 universities  I was accepted by Washington university, colorado state university, and the University of Texas Dallas. They were not affordable for me. 
* After closely working with my professor, I have decided to apply only to USD this spring 2023.


7. What will you do after completing MS ? What are your plans after graduation? How will your study in the U.S be helpful to your home country after you come back?

Answer: 
* After completing my master's degree, I will continue to work with BP Koirala eye foundation research on intelligence systems for blind and deft people. Enriching blind and deaf people via artificial intelligence software.
* Besides that, I will be continuing my previous companies Fusemachines, NAMII, and National innovation as a visiting researcher. 
* Here is a great chance for me to become a pioneer in my field.
